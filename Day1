Problem Statement: 
 The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1 and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as F0 = 0 and F1= 1. For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is F0; therefore, getNthFib(1) is equal to F0, getNthFib(2) is equal to F1, etc.
 
#Solution:
 
 logic:
 int fib(int n) {
        if(n==0)
            return 0;
        if(n==1 || n==2)
            return 1;
        return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
        
    }
